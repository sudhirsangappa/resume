    {\bf Beanbag, Inc.}, Palo Alto, California \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    {\sl Founder} \hfill {\bf November, 2010 -- present }\\
    Beanbag, Inc. is a business founded to support the open-source Review Board
    project. My efforts are currently focused on enabling the use of Review
    Board as a subscription service.

    {\bf VMware, Inc.}, Palo Alto, California \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    {\sl Senior Member of Technical Staff/Engineering Lead} \hfill {\bf August, 2006 -- present}\\
    At VMware, I have helped build and ship several major products as a Linux
    user interface developer on the Workstation/Player team.
    \begin{list2}
    \item I am currently an Engineering Lead with 3 direct reports, focused on
          planning and development for a future release of Workstation and Player.
          Much of the work for this release has been making significant
          architectural changes in order to create a platform for the next 5+
          years of Workstation product development.
    \item I acted as Tech Lead for the Workstation 7.0 release, helping to guide
          the release process. My individual contributions for this release
          included encrypted VMs and the ``pause execution'' feature.
    \item I coordinated a cross-functional team for Record/Replay (a feature
          which allows users to record all the execution state of a running VM,
          down to register values and interrupt timing), and was responsible for
          the design and implementation of the user interface. This major
          feature shipped in Workstation 6.5.
    \item I designed and implemented a revamped fullscreen mode which supports
          multiple monitors and significant refactoring for single-instance and
          multiple-window support in Workstation 6.0 on Linux.
    \item I developed, evangelized and instituted several improvements to
          software development process and infrastructure, including the
          adoption of Review Board for code review, and a set of tools and
          procedures for using Git on top of Perforce for local development.
    \item I have mediated in conflicts between members of my team and other
          groups including product management and QA, as well as between my
          peers and management.
    \item I have mentored several interns and junior employees throughout my
          tenure.

        {\bf University of Colorado}, Boulder, Colorado \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
        {\sl Student Systems Administrator for "CSops"} \hfill {\bf August, 2002 -- July, 2006}\\
        System and network administration, and support of a large conference
        center. This included administration of OpenBSD and Linux servers, as well
        as Linux and Solaris-based student labs. My network administration duties
        involved maintaining routing tables and 802.1q network topologies on a
        variety of network hardware. The conference center support role focused
        mostly on documentation and troubleshooting of a multimillion-dollar
        audio/video setup, including complex switching and control equipment.

        {\bf University of Colorado}, Boulder, Colorado \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
        {\sl Research Assistant} \hfill {\bf January, 2005 -- June, 2006}\\
        As an undergraduate research assistant, I participated in a research
        project dealing with analysis of motion capture data. I built software to
        create probability graphs (similar to markov chains) from a continuous
        motion sequence, and then walked those graphs using chaotic mathematical
        systems, with the goal of creating stylistically consonant interpolations
        between poses in the context of dance choreography.

        {\bf SGI Federal, Inc.}, Englewood, Colorado \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
        {\sl Intern} \hfill {\bf June, 2004 -- August, 2004}\\
        At sgi, I ported customer software from IRIX/MIPS to Linux/Itanium2, and
        worked on integration of chromium (the open-source analog to sgi's OpenGL
        Multipipe) with SGI visualization systems.  I also contributed to
        performance analysis and benchmarking of database systems on various SGI
        Altix configurations.

        {\bf Niwot Networks}, Boulder, Colorado \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
        {\sl Intern} \hfill {\bf May, 2001 -- September, 2001}\\
        As a summer intern, I began work on creating a Linux server for Niwot
        Networks' high-performance file transfer software {\sl Gigabyte Express}.

        {\bf SignalSoft}, Boulder, Colorado \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
        {\sl Intern} \hfill {\bf June, 2000 -- January, 2001}\\
        At SignalSoft, an early mobile location-based services company, I built a
        variety of web-site back-end scripts for customer interaction and intranet
        automation. I also created applications for remote testing of WAP
        (wireless application protocol) content servers for use prior to customer
        and partner demos.

    {\bf Review Board}, \url{http://www.reviewboard.org} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    {\sl Founder, Maintainer} \hfill {\bf January, 2007 -- present}\\
    Review Board is a web-based tool for collaborative code review. Christian
    Hammond and I started Review Board in order to create a tool which would
    satisfy our needs both in the open source world, as well as handle the
    challenge of maintaining a rigorous code review process in a quickly growing
    team at VMware. It supports many revision control systems and provides a
    powerful diff viewer with direct, in-line commenting.

    Review Board is used by hundreds of companies and open-source projects,
    including VMware, Yahoo!, Twitter, and Asterisk, and has had contributions
    from over 150 people. Review Board has participated several times as a
    mentoring organization in Google's Summer of Code program
    (\url{http://code.google.com/soc}) and the Undergraduate Capstone Open
    Source Projects program (\url{http://www.ucosp.ca}).

    {\bf XChat-GNOME}, \url{http://xchat-gnome.navi.cx} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    {\sl Founder, Maintainer} \hfill {\bf 2004 -- 2007}\\
    XChat-GNOME was a new front-end to the popular ``Xchat'' IRC client, with an
    emphasis on ease of use, simplicity and desktop integration.  I created
    XChat-GNOME because I was dissatisfied with all of the existing clients,
    which all required extensive configuration and learning curves to start
    using, and then got in the user's way with lots of cluttered UI.
    XChat-GNOME maintenance has been passed off to Ritesh Khadgaray.

    {\bf Fyre}, \url{http://fyre.navi.cx} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    {\sl Founder, Maintainer} \hfill {\bf 2003 -- 2006}\\
    Fyre is a software system to produce computational art from chaotic maps
    with advanced features such as animation and cluster rendering.  One of the
    algorithms developed for Fyre won first place in the undergraduate division
    of the ACM student research competition at SIGGRAPH 2004.

    \ifcv
        {\bf BZFlag}, \url{http://www.bzflag.org} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
        {\sl Core Developer} \hfill {\bf 2000 -- 2006}\\
        BZFlag is an online, 3D multiplayer action game which runs on over a dozen
        different platforms.  It is one of the most popular games ever on Silicon
        Graphics (sgi) machines. My contributions include large architecture changes
        during the 1.8/1.9 development cycle, assistance with developing a new
        rendering engine and many other small features, as well as several versions
        of a WYSIWYG linux map editor named “bzedit” from 2000-2003.

        {\bf Evolution}, \url{http://gnome.org/projects/evolution} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
        {\sl Contributor} \hfill {\bf 2003 -- 2005}\\
        Evolution is a popular application for the GNOME desktop which provides
        E-mail, addressbook and calendaring features.  My particular contributions
        include calendar publishing, weather calendars and updates to the
        documentation.  These contributions were made as part of the GNOME bounties
        program sponsored by Novell.
